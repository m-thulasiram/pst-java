**Week 1 Java Programs
📌 Overview**

This repository contains Week 1 Java programs focused on basic array operations, searching algorithms, number-based problems, and fundamental logic building using Java.
Each program follows a structured format including Aim, Algorithm, Program, Output, and Result, suitable for academic lab/practical submissions.

**🛠 Requirements**

Java JDK 8 or higher

Any Java IDE (VS Code / IntelliJ / Eclipse / NetBeans)

Command Prompt / Terminal (optional)

**📂 List of Programs**
🔹 Task 1: Access Element in an Array

Accesses and prints an element at a given index

Handles invalid index conditions

🔹 Task 2: Binary Search in Sorted Array

Searches an element using Binary Search technique

Returns index if found, otherwise displays not found

🔹 Task 3: Maximum Element in an Array

Finds the largest element from an integer array

🔹 Task 4: Kth Smallest Element

Sorts the array and finds the Kth smallest element

🔹 Task 5: Print All Possible Pairs in an Array

Generates and prints all unique pairs of array elements

🔹 Task 6: Sum of Digits (Even / Odd Option)

Calculates sum of either even or odd digits based on user choice

🔹 Task 7: Nth Fibonacci Number

Computes the Nth Fibonacci number using iteration

🔹 Task 8: Palindrome Number Check

Checks whether a given number is a palindrome

Returns 2 if palindrome, otherwise 1

🔹 Task 9: Sum of Last Digits
